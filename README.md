# BreakOut
This game is based off the original Atari arcade game and follows a similar set of rules. <br />

The goal is to get rid of all the bricks before running out of lives. <br />
You have 3 lives, and each life is lost when the paddle misses the ball. <br/>
You can move the paddle left and right by using the left and right arrows, respectively. <br />
The brick colors correspond to the number of points you can score: yellow (1 pt); green (3 pts); orange (5 pts); red (7 pts) <br />
The ball speed increases 4 times throughout the game: <br /> 1) after the ball hits the paddle 4 times; <br /> 2) after the ball hits the paddle 12 times; <br />  3) after the first orange brick is broken; <br/>  4) after the first red brick is broken.  <br />
The game stores your high scores in a data.txt file.  <br />
Good luck!
